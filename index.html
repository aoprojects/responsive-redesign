            <h2>Static Websites Damage Sales</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bounce rates in excess of 50%: most customers leave your site ASAP</li>
                <li>Second most common reason for leaving a site, only behind slow loading</li>
                <li>1 in 3 customers abandon a purchase due to the annoyance of a static site</li>
                <li>69% of customers prefer to order online than over the phone </li>
                <li>55% of all e-commerce interactions taking place on smartphones</li>
                <li>42% of customers will post a poor review, vs just 24% over the phone [what does this one mean?]</li>
                <li>[waste of time and money to have a separate site for each mobile, tablet, deskto.] [Number of different devices that represent different screen sizes]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Having a fully responsive website has never been more critical.</p>

            <h2>Benefits Of Responsive Websites</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce your bounce rate to less than 20% (Forbes)
                <li>User feel like you are a modern company who is always ready for them, wherever device they’re on.  This means they feel they can trust your brand.
                <li>Customers can interact with you quickly, rather than put your site on a list to ‘deal with later’ when they’re at a desktop.

            <h2>Your options - How to fix your site</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Do it yourself. You can use a template engine. They cost time to edit, money per feature (like custom domains), and they offer limited pre-set functionality. They also often hiden their back end code, which means you'll have to hire an expensive design agency ($5,000 minimums are common) to hack around the template's limitations.</li>
                <li>[option 2]</li>
                <li>Hire Responsive Redesign. Your new, custom, mobilee responsive site can be uploaded live to your custom domain, with your custom features, in a week or less – for cheap.</li>
